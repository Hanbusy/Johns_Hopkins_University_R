## Vectorized Operations

Many operations in R are vectorized making code more efficient, concise, and easier to read.

```{r}
x <- 1:4; y<- 6:9
x + y
x >2
x >= 2
y == 8
x * y
x / y
```

## Vectorized Matrix Operations
```{r}
x <- matrix(1:4, 2, 2); y<- matrix(rep(10,4),2,2)  
x * y   ## element-wise multiplication
x / y
x %*% y  ## true matrix multiplication
```
